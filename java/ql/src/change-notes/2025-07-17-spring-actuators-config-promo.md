* The query `java/insecure-spring-actuator-config` has been promoted from experimental to the main query pack as `java/spring-boot-exposed-actuators-config`. Its results will now appear by default. This query detects exposure of Spring Boot actuators through configuration files. It was originally submitted as an experimental query [by @luchua-bc](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/5384).
