* The tag `quality` has been added to multiple Python quality queries for consistency. They have all been given a tag for one of the two top-level categories `reliability` or `maintainability`, and a tag for a sub-category. See [Query file metadata and alert message style guide](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/docs/query-metadata-style-guide.md#quality-query-sub-category-tags) for more information about these categories.
