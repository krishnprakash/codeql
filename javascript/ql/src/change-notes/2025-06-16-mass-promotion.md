* The `quality` tag has been added to multiple JavaScript quality queries, with tags for `reliability` or `maintainability` categories and their sub-categories. See [Query file metadata and alert message style guide](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/docs/query-metadata-style-guide.md#quality-query-sub-category-tags) for more information about these categories.
