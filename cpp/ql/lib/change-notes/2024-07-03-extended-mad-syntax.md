* The syntax for models-as-data rows has been extended to make it easier to select sources, sinks, and summaries that involve templated functions and classes. Additionally, the syntax has also been extended to make it easier to specify models with arbitrary levels of indirection. See `dataflow/ExternalFlow.qll` for the updated documentation and specification for the model format.
